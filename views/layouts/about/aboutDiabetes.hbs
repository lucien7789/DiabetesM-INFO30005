        <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
        <p>Diabetes is a medical condition where the body cannot maintain healthy blood glucose levels.
            <br><b>Insulin</b> is the hormone enabling the body to properly break down sugars in food; a
            diabetic is unable to adequately produce insulin, or produce any insulin at all. <br>This can
            lead to serious health complications if not properly treated. Diabetes technology has seen much
            innovation in recent years, enabling more effective diabetes management. For more information on
            new diabetes technology, click <a

                <p><b>Type 1 diabetes</b> accounts for approximately 10 percent of all diabetes cases. It is an
                    auto-immune condition with unknown causes, although there is a strong genetic link. It
                    cannot be prevented or cured, but it can be managed effectively, leading to a healthy
                    life with few complications. Type 1 diabetes management involves multiple daily insulin
                    injections and regular blood glucose monitoring.

                <p><b>Type 2 diabetes</b> accounts for approximately 85 percent of all diabetes cases. Type 2
                    diabetes is caused by a gradual buildup of insulin resistance in the body. Long term
                    lifestyle choices, such as dietary and exercise habits, have a significant effect on
                    the development of Type 2 diabetes. Genetic and ethnic factors are also significant.
                    Type 2 diabetes can lead to significant health complications if unchecked, but can
                    be managed through healthy eating, regular exercise, and in some cases tablets or
                    insulin.
